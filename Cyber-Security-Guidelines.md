## 1. Current Security Measures 

* Use of strong and unique passwords for each account.
* Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) enabled on critical platforms (email, cloud services).
* Regular software updates and security patches.
* Avoid clicking suspicious links or downloading unknown attachments.
* Use of trusted Wi-Fi networks and VPN when accessing sensitive data.

**Where I Can Improve:**

* Improve password rotation frequency (change passwords periodically).
* Use a password manager to securely store and generate credentials.
* Review and adjust app permissions more regularly.

## 2. Making Secure Behaviour a Habit 

To make cybersecurity second nature rather than an afterthought:

* Integrate **security checks** into daily workflows (before pushing code or sharing data).
* Practice a **‚Äútrust but verify‚Äù** mindset for all links, emails, and access requests.
* Automate certain safety habits, such as using password managers and enabling biometric locks.

## 3. Steps to Ensure Password & Account Security 

* Use **complex passwords** with a mix of upper/lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
* Enable **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** or hardware keys wherever possible.
* Store passwords only in **encrypted password managers** (Bitwarden, 1Password).
* Avoid password reuse across platforms.
* Review **account login activity** periodically for unauthorized access.

## 4. Responding to a Suspected Breach 

If I suspect a breach or unusual account activity:

1. **Immediately change passwords** for all affected accounts.
2. **Revoke active sessions** and log out from all devices.
3. **Enable 2FA** if not already done.
4. **Check for unauthorized actions** (emails sent, settings changed, code pushed, etc.).
5. **Report the issue** to the service provider‚Äôs security or support team.
6. **Run antivirus and malware scans** on all connected devices.
7. Reflect and document what caused the breach to prevent future incidents.
