**What do I want to learn**  
I want real experience building and shipping mobile app features—especially working with React Native and native modules, backend setup, and CI/CD.

**Skills I’m excited about:**  
- Connecting native code with React Native  
- Making apps work well offline  
- Wroking with native settings 
- Testing and debugging for mobile

**How can I help the team**  
I’ve built React Native apps before (UI, navigation, custom features). I can help with routines, writing algorithms, and improving docs and workflows.

**What do I want to get better at?**  
 - Working with a team
 - Hands on experience of resolving real life problems
 - Learn building apps with react native more deeply.

**What’s success for me**  
Shipping a good feature, learning native integrations, making the app more reliable, and leaving behind good docs so it’s easier for the next person.
