## AI Tools Tried
- **GitHub Copilot** – suggests code snippets directly in VS Code.
- **ChatGPT** – used for coding questions, debugging, and explanations.
- **Claude AI** – explored as an alternative AI assistant for coding.
- **Gemini** – used to prototype designs by recreating them from other websites.

## What Worked Well
- Copilot quickly provided boilerplate code and repetitive patterns.
- ChatGPT was helpful for debugging, understanding errors, and explaining concepts.
- Gemini can rapidly generate design prototypes.

## What Didn’t Work Well
- Copilot sometimes suggested incorrect code or outdated patterns.
- Claude AI was slower and less accurate on some programming-specific questions.
- Gemini struggles with user prompts, often ignores responsiveness, and uses unappealing colors and fonts.

## When AI is Most Useful
AI is most useful for:
- Generating repetitive code patterns.
- Quick debugging hints.
- Learning new programming concepts and APIs.
- Rapid prototyping for design ideas (with manual adjustments needed).
