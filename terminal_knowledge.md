## Which terminal client did you choose? Why?
I chose **Windows Terminal with PowerShell** because it's fast, clean, and lets me keep multiple tabs open. It also works well with Git and VS Code.

## What customizations did you make?
Just simple ones for now: a clean theme and a few quality‑of‑life tweaks. I plan to add aliases later.

## Most useful command I learned today
Did you know you can check your current directory structure with `tree`? It gives a quick visual overview of your folders.
