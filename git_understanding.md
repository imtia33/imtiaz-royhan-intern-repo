## Why are PRs important in a team workflow?

PRs allow teams to review each other's code, catch bugs early, and keep track of changes. They help maintain code quality and make collaboration easier.

## What makes a well-structured PR?

A good PR is:
- Clear title and description
- Focused on one topic or issue
- Contains meaningful commit messages
- Passes tests and follows style guides
- Includes screenshots if UI is changed
- Updates documentation when needed
- Highlights anything that needs special attention

## What did you learn from reviewing an open-source PR?

I learned the importance of clear communication, good feedback, and thorough testing. Reviewing PRs made me write better PRs myself.
