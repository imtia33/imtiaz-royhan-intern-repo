## Have you used Git before?
Yes — I have used Git in various development projects. Most of my usage involved version control for personal projects, university assignments, and collaborative repositories on GitHub. I'm comfortable with basic commands like `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, and branching.

## Which Git client did you choose? Why?
I chose to use **Git inside VS Code** because:
- It integrates directly with my editor.
- I can stage, commit, view diffs, and switch branches without leaving VS Code.
- The UI is clean and works well for daily development.

I also installed the Git command line tools so I can use the terminal when needed.

## Most interesting thing I learned today
Did you know you can undo a commit without losing your changes using `git reset --soft`? I didn't — and it's genuinely useful for quick fixes.
