# Reflection

## Which shortcuts will be most useful?
Multiple cursors, selecting repeated occurrences, and quick file navigation will be the most useful for daily development work. They reduce mouse usage and make code editing much faster.

## How keyboard shortcuts improve productivity
Keyboard shortcuts remove the need to navigate menus and reach for the mouse repeatedly. They help maintain flow, reduce task switching time, and make repetitive tasks like editing, navigating, and debugging significantly faster.
