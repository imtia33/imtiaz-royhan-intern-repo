# Workspace & Ergonomic Reflection

## Equipment Improvements

To make my workspace more comfortable and efficient, I can:

* Use an **external monitor** for better screen height and visibility.
* Use an **ergonomic chair** or seat cushion for back support.
* Keep the **keyboard and mouse** at elbow height to reduce wrist strain.

## Behavioural Improvements

To improve posture and reduce strain, I will:

* **Sit upright** with feet flat on the floor and shoulders relaxed.
* Take **short standing or stretching breaks** every 45–60 minutes.
* Adjust **screen height and lighting** to prevent neck and eye strain.
* Avoid working long hours in one position — move regularly.

## Building Healthy Habits

* Use **Focus Bear** to schedule **movement and posture reminders** throughout the day.
* Set gentle **notifications or alarms** for stretching or screen breaks.
