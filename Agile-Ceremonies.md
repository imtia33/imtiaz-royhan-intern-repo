## How Agile Ceremonies Help with Communication and Alignment

Agile ceremonies are short, focused meetings that keep everyone connected and informed. They give us quick moments to talk about progress, tackle problems, and plan the next steps so we’re always in sync.

- **Sprint Planning**: We agree on what to do next and who’s doing what.
- **Daily Stand-up**: Quick check-in to share updates and highlight blockers.
- **Sprint Review**: Show what we finished and get feedback.
- **Sprint Retrospective**: Chat about what went well and how we can improve.

These meetings break down barriers and help everyone stay on the same page.

## Most Important Ceremony for My Role

The **Daily Stand-up** is key for me. It’s a fast way to see how everyone’s doing, spot issues early, and keep the team moving forward together.
