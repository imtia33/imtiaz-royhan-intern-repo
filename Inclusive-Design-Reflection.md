**Inclusive communication:**
I can adjust my communication by being **more patient, direct, and clear**, avoiding vague phrases or sudden changes. Using concise summaries, visual aids, and structured updates can help teammates and users stay aligned.

**Common pitfalls in Focus Bear:**

* Personally I dont find any issue in the system but I did face a button not working while tring to give overlay access.

**One practical improvement:**
Implement a **“Focus Mode Simplify” toggle** that reduces distractions by minimizing visual clutter and simplifying UI elements — helpful for users with ADHD or sensory sensitivity.there can exsit a default/previuous session duration saved, where user can change if they want to.

### **Updated Reflection**

In my reflection, I discussed strategies for inclusive communication and suggested a UI improvement to make digital tools more accessible for neurodivergent users.

#### **1. First-person accoun **

**Source:** *“What It’s Like to Have ADHD as an Adult”* by Jessica McCabe (YouTube channel *How to ADHD*).
**Summary:**
Jessica McCabe, who has ADHD, shares how everyday tasks—like replying to emails or starting projects—can feel overwhelming due to executive dysfunction. She explains that forgetfulness, time blindness, and emotional regulation challenges often lead to frustration or self-blame, even though these are symptoms of how ADHD brains work. She emphasizes that clear, encouraging communication and flexible tools (like visual reminders or progress feedback) help her stay engaged and supported.

#### **2. Supportive response example (scenario + message)**

**Scenario:**
A user messages:

> “I’ve been trying to finish my project for days, but I just can’t focus. Every time I start, I get distracted or overwhelmed. I feel like I’m failing.”

**My response:**

> "You’re not failing. It’s normal to feel overwhelmed sometimes. Try breaking your project into small steps—for example, just opening the file or writing one sentence. If you want, I can help you plan what to do next. Reaching out is already a great start."
