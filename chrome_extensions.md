# Chrome Extensions Setup

## Extensions Installed
- **React Developer Tools** – to inspect React component trees and props.
- **Redux DevTools** – helpful for tracking Redux state changes.
- **JSON Viewer** – makes API responses readable and shows JSON objects in a tree-like visual structure.
- **Lighthouse** – used for auditing performance, accessibility, and best practices.

## Why These Extensions?
They cover the essentials for modern web development: debugging UI state, reading API data quickly, and checking performance.

## Most Useful Thing I Learned
Did you know Lighthouse can simulate slow network conditions and CPU throttling? It’s a quick way to see how your app performs on low-end devices.
