# Responsible Use of AI — Reflection

## When to Use AI 

Use AI for quick ideas, summaries, debugging, and productivity.
Rely on personal skills for critical thinking, ethical choices, creative work, and handling sensitive data.

---

## Avoiding Over-Reliance 

* Treat AI as a **guide**, not a replacement.
* **Verify & Test** all outputs before using them.
* Keep improving core skills through practice and learning.

---

## Data Privacy 

* Never share **personal or confidential data (Api, passwords)** with AI tools.
* Review **privacy policies** before use.
* Prefer **local or secure platforms** for sensitive tasks.

## Task Improved with AI 

I used a figma ai plugin to genarate a design based on a framer website template.

## Reviewing the Output 

The genarated design was upto 90% accurate.

## Best Practice at Focus Bear 

I will always **review and fact-check AI outputs** before use.
AI can speed up work, but **final responsibility** for quality, accuracy, and ethics stays with me.
