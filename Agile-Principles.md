# Agile Reflection

## Benefits of Agile

* **Flexibility:** Agile allows quick adaptation to feedback and changing requirements.
* **Continuous improvement:** Regular retrospectives help identify and fix workflow issues.
* **Collaboration:** Encourages open communication between developers, designers, and stakeholders.
* **Faster delivery:** Work is released in small, functional increments, ensuring early value.

## Challenges of Agile

* **Scope creep:** Constant changes can lead to unclear or shifting goals if not managed properly.
* **Coordination issues:** Requires consistent communication; remote teams may find this difficult.
* **Incomplete documentation:** Emphasis on speed can sometimes lead to missing details.
* **Dependence on discipline:** Teams must stay engaged and organized to keep sprints effective.

## Applying Agile Principles to My Role

* **Iterative development:** Break down features into smaller deliverables for quicker feedback.
* **Daily communication:** Stay transparent about progress and blockers to keep collaboration smooth.
* **Continuous learning:** Reflect after each sprint to improve code quality and workflow.
* **User focus:** Prioritize user experience by regularly testing and refining based on feedback.


## Scrum vs. Kanban (Summary)

* **Scrum** is a structured framework with defined roles (like Scrum Master and Product Owner), fixed-length sprints, and specific ceremonies such as daily stand-ups and sprint retrospectives. Work is planned at the start of each sprint, and changes are typically avoided mid-cycle.
* **Kanban**, on the other hand, is more flexible and continuous. There are no fixed sprints or roles; tasks flow through stages on a visual board. Work-in-progress limits ensure focus and smooth delivery without strict timeboxes.

In short, Scrum is more structured with time-based iterations, while Kanban is more fluid and focuses on continuous flow and adaptability.

## Agile Principle That Resonates with Me

**“Responding to change over following a plan.”**
This principle resonates with me because software projects often evolve as new insights or user feedback emerge. At Focus Bear, I’ll apply this by staying open to iteration—adapting my approach or refactoring code when a better solution appears, instead of rigidly sticking to the original plan. This mindset will help me stay flexible and deliver real value, even when requirements shift.
