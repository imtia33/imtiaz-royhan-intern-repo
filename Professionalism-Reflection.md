# Reflections

## teamwork experience:
- I did worked with my friends as a team in my university projects. It helped us better colaboration and knowing each other's weak points.

## Clear and respectful communication:
- Sometimes we talked over online or sometimes we met personally to talk about it. We talk in concise, kind, and specific manners.

## Creating a positive environment:
- Encourage teammates, celebrate small wins, and offer help when someone struggles. Keep the mood friendly but focused.

## Preparing for meetings:
- Review the agenda, gather updates or blockers, and keep notes ready for efficient discussions.

## Being proactive during my internship:
- Take initiative to fix small issues, suggest improvements, and follow up when tasks are pending — without waiting for reminders.

## Following up or escalating:

- If I need a response, I’ll send a polite reminder after 24–48 hours.
If no reply after reasonable attempts, I’ll escalate respectfully through the proper channel or to my supervisor.

## Things I won’t do:

* Ignore feedback or deadlines.
* Use negative or sarcastic tone in messages.
* Gossip or speak disrespectfully about teammates.
* React emotionally before understanding the situation.
