# Reflections

## teamwork experience:
- I did worked with my friends as a team in my university projects. It helped us better colaboration and knowing each other's weak points.

## Clear and respectful communication:
- Sometimes we talked over online or sometimes we met personally to talk about it. We talk in concise, kind, and specific manners.

## Creating a positive environment:
- Encourage teammates, celebrate small wins, and offer help when someone struggles. Keep the mood friendly but focused.

## Preparing for meetings:
- Review the agenda, gather updates or blockers, and keep notes ready for efficient discussions.

## Being proactive during my internship:
- Take initiative to fix small issues, suggest improvements, and follow up when tasks are pending — without waiting for reminders.

## Following up or escalating:

- If I need a response, I’ll send a polite reminder after 24–48 hours.
If no reply after reasonable attempts, I’ll escalate respectfully through the proper channel or to my supervisor.

## Things I won’t do:

* Ignore feedback or deadlines.
* Use negative or sarcastic tone in messages.
* Gossip or speak disrespectfully about teammates.
* React emotionally before understanding the situation.

## A short story of colaboration:
 On the second semester, we made a Chat application with C++ and QT. We were a 3 person group. Shalman is one of them. He tries to experiments things. On this project he changed the client app code for the server ip and port address. Which caused the app fail to connect to the server. I was assigned as the person to implement the server and client app connection so I was able to find and fix the connection error. It took me 1.5 min to fix. While I was fixing it , Tareef, the second person, opened his laptop and continued the connection and continued the presentation while I was fixing Shalmans code. My teacher was Impressed by this colaboration of how quickly we fixed the problem and how we were able to seemlessly continue the presentation.
