#  Data Security & Privacy Reflection

##  Handling Data Securely

To ensure I handle data securely in my daily work, I will:

* Access data **only when necessary** and follow the principle of **least privilege**.
* Use **strong, unique passwords** and enable **2FA** on all work accounts.
* Keep my device and software **updated** to prevent vulnerabilities.
* Avoid storing sensitive data locally unless it’s encrypted and approved.

##  Storing, Sharing & Disposing of Data

* **Store:** Use **secure, encrypted storage** platforms (e.g., company-approved cloud tools).
* **Share:** Only share sensitive files through **authorized channels**, with **access controls** in place.
* **Dispose:** Permanently delete sensitive files from all devices and **clear from backups** if no longer needed.
* Avoid copying sensitive data to personal devices or unverified storage systems.
