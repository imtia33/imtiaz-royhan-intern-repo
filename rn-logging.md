## Why is logging important in a production React Native app?

Logging helps you understand what's happening in your app when real users are using it. It catches bugs, shows user behavior, and helps you fix problems fast instead of guessing.

## How does Sentry improve debugging and issue tracking?

Sentry automatically catches and reports errors from your live app. It shows you exactly where crashes happen, what users were doing, and groups similar issues together - all in real time.

## What are best practices for handling and logging errors?

- Catch errors early with try/catch
- Log useful details (but not sensitive info)
- Use structured logging formats
- Set up alerts for critical issues
- Test your error handling works
