## What makes Focus Bear different?
Focus Bear mixes **distraction blocking** with **guided routines**. Most apps do one or the other. It’s built with neurodivergent users in mind, so the flows are simple, predictable, and forgiving. The AI relevance check (blocking only when something is actually off‑task) is also something you don’t usually see in traditional blockers.

## Why would I choose Focus Bear?
If I wanted an app that helps me stay on track *without feeling strict or punishing*, I’d lean toward Focus Bear. The routine guidance plus blocking means I wouldn’t need to juggle multiple apps. It’s also appealing if I struggle with executive functioning and want something that nudges me gently instead of locking me out harshly.

## What’s one feature other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?
Cold Turkey and Freedom have **very hard lockdown modes**—they’re intentionally difficult to bypass. Focus Bear doesn’t really position itself that way; it’s more flexible.

## One improvement Focus Bear could make
Adding an **optional strict mode** (not the default, just for people who want it) would help cover users who sometimes need an uncompromising “no escape” period for deep work.
